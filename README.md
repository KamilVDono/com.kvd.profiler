# Description

Naive, but still powerful and fast implementation of ECS (Entity-Components-Systems) which is intended to
be used with Unity. For now it's DO NOT use Unity's DOTS, but maybe in future it would be possible.

Whole workflow will be clarified, refined and simplified over time by usage and experience.

**As it's intended to be used with Unity, it depends on Unity features.**

By simple benchmarks, it's faster than [LeoEcsLite](https://github.com/Leopotam/ecslite).
The same time LeoEcsLite provides other feature set. And further benchmarking should be done.
